# About
Design project 1 is posted here: [RPSLs](http://ee363f15.fanel.li/documents/design1.pdf).

Please create a new Eclipse Project named **rpsls** and share it to your EE363 GitLab repository. Use this project to implement your solution.

You are encouraged to work in teams of 2 on the design of your project, however everyone is responsible for their own implementation.

## Code Requirements:
* You must conform to Java coding style conventions discussed in class.
* You must utilize JavaDoc style commenting on all public declarations.
* You must document uses of all design patterns and principles
in your class comments! 

## Design Requirements:
* UML Diagrams showing your object design, and design patterns
* UML Sequence diagram showing the execution flow of a single round of play

## Extra Credit
Provide a GamePlay object that allows rounds to be played interactively, with the following requirements:
* A player may be a human user, or the computer.
* You must use the Strategy Pattern to implement the Player and Game structures.

**Scoring**: Your extra credit will be scored independently as either “no credit,” “half-credit” or “full credit,” and may be used at the end of the semester to add up to a full letter grade to ANY exam or project of your choice this semester.
