# About
Take home exam 1 is posted here: [Exam 2](http://ee363f15.fanel.li/documents/exam2.pdf). Please print and complete the exam, and slide it under my office door during deadweek.

You are encouraged to work together, use Eclipse, Git, and other tools to work through the problems. **However**, all written answers must represent your own understanding of the problem and solution. It is best to work in teams to figure out the problems, but **do not** work together while writing your answers. Sitting with your group while writing your answers results in *very similar* answers that will look like you've copied your work. The only way to avoid this is to work indepdently when you have pen-to-paper on the exam.
