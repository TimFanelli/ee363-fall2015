# Gitlab Server

GitLab is deployed here:
  [https://gitlab.camp.clarkson.edu](https://gitlab.camp.clarkson.edu)

Please note: at the moment, we seem to be having trouble accessing that server from the ClarksonUniversity wi-fi. I've opened a ticket with OIT to get it resolved. In the meantime, please try accessing the server by IP instead:

  [https://128.153.13.235/](https://128.153.13.235)

# Getting Started

Please read the [getting started guide](/documents/GettingStartedwithGitLab.pdf).
