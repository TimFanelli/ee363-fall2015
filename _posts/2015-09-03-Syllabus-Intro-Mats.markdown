# Syllabus

You'll find the course syllabus here: <a href="/documents/EE363Fall2015.pdf">EE363 Fall 2015 Syllabus</a>

# Intro Materials

The lectures slides from the first week of class, covering the Syllabus, introducing Java, and leading into the Liskov Substitution Principle for behavioral inheritance can be found here: <a href="/documents/EE363Fall2015Intro.pdf">EE363 Fall 2015 Intro</a>.

We will be using GitLab this semester to exchange source code, project notes, and other materials. The HelloWorld and LiskovDemonstration sample projects can be found on our GitLab server, here: [https://gitlab.camp.clarkson.edu/ee363/fall2015](https://gitlab.camp.clarkson.edu/ee363/fall2015)

Please note - you must log into GitLab at least once, before I can add you to the project -- so when you first log in, you won't see anything. Shoot me an email and I'll add you to the project.
